# SpiderMonkeyOptimization Algorithm with Java and JavaFX

## Overview
This repository contains an implementation of the SpiderMonkeyOptimization algorithm using Java. Additionally, it includes visualization of the algorithm's behavior using JavaFX.
## SpiderMonkeyOptimization Algorithm
The SpiderMonkeyOptimization algorithm (SMO) is a nature-inspired optimization algorithm that draws inspiration from the foraging behavior of spider monkeys in their natural habitat. Spider monkeys are known for their efficient and agile movement through the forest canopy in search of food sources.
## Features
- Implementation of the SpiderMonkeyOptimization algorithm in Java.
- Visualization of the algorithm's progress and behavior using JavaFX.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java development environment (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Run the `SpiderMonkeyApplication.java` file to execute the SpiderMonkeyOptimization algorithm.
4. Follow the prompts to input parameters and observe the algorithm's progress through the JavaFX visualization.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- JavaFX (included in JDK 8 and later)
